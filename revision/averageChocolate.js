// Average Chocolates Ended
// Description

// Vishal asked his mother to buy a pack of chocolates for him ,She agreed to buy but on one condition ,vishal has to solve one question,  if he answered he will be given all the chocolates.

// Vishal has N number of friends Each friend has some choclates with him which are given in an array A, and there are Q number of queries .Each query contains an integer K ,he has to choose a subset S from given Array A such that the average of S is less than K.

// He has to print the maximum possible length of S.

// Input
// Input Format :

// -     The first line of each input contains  N, length of array A.

// -     Next line contains N space separated elements of array A.

// -     Next line of input contains an integer Q, Number of queries.

// -     Each following Q  lines contains a single integer K.

// Constraints :

// 1 < = N <=
// 1
// 0
// 5
// 10
// 5

// 1 <= Q < =
// 5
// ∗
// 1
// 0
// 5
// 5∗10
// 5

// 1
// 1 <= A[i],K <=
// 1
// 0
// 9
// 10
// 9

// Output
// For each query, print single integer denoting the maximum possible length of the subset.

// Sample Input 1

// 5
// 1 2 3 4 5
// 5
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
// Sample Output 1

// 0
// 2
// 4
// 5
// 5
// Hint

// Output Explanation :

// In first query, there is no possible subset such that its average is less than 1.

// In second query, you can select the subset {1,2}.

// In third query, you can select the subset {1,2,3,4}.

// In fourth and fifth query, you can seelct the complete array {1,2,3,4,5}.
