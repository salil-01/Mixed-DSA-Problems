// Nobita and A Ended
// Description

// Given a string find the length of largest substring which starts at 'a' and ends at 'a' as well.

// The String contains lowercase Alphabet.

// e.g.:

// "abcdavn" , the substring starting and ending at a is : "abcda" the output will be 5

// Note: The string will contain only 2 or less a's present, so there will not be any case like this "cdababfa"

// Input
// Input Format:

// First line of input contains the number N , denoting the length of the string.

// Second line of input contains the string.

// Constraints:

// 1<=N<=100

// 0<=Number of a's present in the string <=2

// Output
// Output an integer which is the length of largest substring which starts and ends at 'a'

// Sample Input 1

// 7
// abcdavn
// Sample Output 1

// 5
// Sample Input 2

// 6
// bcgfah
// Sample Output 2

// 0
// Hint

// In Sample 2:

// "bcgfah"

// The count of a's in the string is less than 'a' , so there will not be any sub-string which starts at 'a' and ends at 'a'as well, Output will be 0

// Note:if the count of a's in the string is one then the output will be 0 as there is no sub-string which starts at 'a' and ends at 'a'
